Making some progress on the MVC front. Now that I've initiated the basics in all three, things are starting to work as expected. Still, there's a to go! Pick up the controllers section on the website and then keep going. I think once this structure is in place, it will help with the overall app as it grows in complexity.


Random Notes for the Project:
What I want at first is a basic flashcard program with a working SRS algorythm.
Should I get the html dom structure working first
Or the SRS working first

I think either will work. If I'm just using data that already exists, then I can work on making the system easier to add cards to, then I can begin testing the recall algo.

So, next step, get some kind of dom action going, then start the huge chunk
