# Minderva
A modern spaced-repetition-system (SRS) for knowledge retention.

// VERSION 0.005 (WIP)
// - Core functionality is there, now the goals are:
// 
// - MAKE SORTA PRETTY(leads to SPA)
// - STORE DATA(leads to SRS Algo)
// - IMPROVED VALIDATION (leads to less bugs)
// - REFACTOR(leads to better readability/editability)
// 
// - it should have the option to say whether you got the card wrong or right
// - it should show an error if a card doesn't exist for edit or delete
// - display cards should use the display method? (the method is now obsolete?)

Notes:
- Perhaps a validate input function that I can easily apply to any form field

// SOMEDAY MAYBE:
// - it should provide answer validation for typed in answers
// - could you use the nature of arrays and delete to maintain a private index?
